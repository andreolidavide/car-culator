# Car-culator
Hey all, welcome to Car-culator! 

In this repo you'll find a model that will let you predict the price at which you can sell your car in the used market!

It is intended to be more of a data science exercise then anything else, but it should hopefully still prove useful, at least for the italian used market.

# Project content
As of know, all the work is placed inside the one Jupyter Notebook. Data is stored locally.

# Project Roadmap
The roadmap of the project will be the following:
- Data extraction: extract used car data from a used car ads website, store it locally --> completed
- Data wrangling: get a sense of the data, prepare it for further analysis --> running
- Data visualization: visualize the relationship between variables using graphs
- Data modelling: construct a prediction model, testing different models with a train / test split
- Model delivery: prepare a dashboard for data visualization and model delivery

All this is done during my free time, so it will take some time.
